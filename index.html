        <h3> About Me </h3>

        <p>I am a DePaul University computer science bachelor currently seeking employment as a software engineer.</p>


        <h3> Work Experience </h3>

        <p>At DePaul I worked as an intern under professors Corin Pitcher, James Riley, and Radha Jagadeesan on a digital forensics project. I wrote and tested file system forensics software intended to benefit law enforcement agencies, which extracted and verified data from file systems so as to improve the credibility of evidence brought to court. My focus was on writing software for examining data stored in Microsoft's proprietary NTFS file system. Since NTFS has no publicly available specification, I had instead relied on information about the file system that had been previously gathered through reverse engineering as in <a href="http://www.digital-evidence.org/fsfa/">File Sytem Forensic Analysis by Brian Carrier</a>. I wrote software in a variety of programming languages for the project including Java, Scala, Coq, and OCaml.</p>


        <h3> Open Data </h3>

        <p>One of my interests is in creating applications from open government data. One example of this is the <a href="https://github.com/mmcdon20/chicago_police_map">Chicago Police Map</a> application I wrote using Ruby on Rails, Leaflet, and JQuery. The application takes crime data from the <a href="https://data.cityofchicago.org/">City of Chicago Data Portal</a>, and plots criminal activity on a map of Chicago by police wards.</p>

        <p>I have also developed a <a href="https://github.com/mmcdon20/clearpath-scala-client">ClearPath Scala Client</a> for the <a href="http://api1.chicagopolice.org/clearpath/">Chicago Police's ClearPath REST API</a>, using AKKA and Spray.</p>


        <h3> Other Projects </h3>

        <p>One project I have developed is <a href="https://github.com/mmcdon20/zipper">zipper</a>. Zipper is a library for Scala that aims to simplify writing collections of files to zip archives, and extracting collections of files from zip archives. The library is designed to be easy to use as well as thread safe.</p>

        <p>A project I developed in collaboration with other students at DePaul is <a href="http://github.com/mmcdon20/MusicApp">JamTunes</a>. JamTunes is a Web2Py application for social music sharing and discussion.</p>


        <h3> Problem Solving </h3>

        <p>I participated in the 2013 ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest, on the DePaul Lost Souls team. At the competition, we were asked to solve <a href="http://mcicpc.cs.atu.edu/archives/2013/mcpc2013/browse.html">this series of problems</a> in either C++ or Java. Our <a href="http://mcicpc.cs.atu.edu/reports/mcpc2013.final.html">final ranking</a> for the competition was 31st out of 129 participating teams.</p>

        <p>In my spare time, I occasionally like to solve programming problems. I've solved several problems from past <a href="https://github.com/mmcdon20/ACM_Problem_Solving">ACM programming competitions in Java</a>, I've solved problems from <a href="https://github.com/mmcdon20/Euler">Project Euler in Scala</a> as well as <a href="https://github.com/mmcdon20/euler_ruby">in Ruby</a>, and I've solved problems from <a href="https://github.com/mmcdon20/code_abbey">CodeAbbey in Scala</a> as well.</p>
